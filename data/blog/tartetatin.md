⦁ Wash the apples, peel them, and cut them into cubes by removing the core and seeds. Place the apple cubes in a bowl and pour lemon juice on top. Toss so that the lemon juice covers each piece. This will stop the apples from browning.  
⦁ In an iron cast skillet, add butter and place it on medium heat.  
⦁ Add sugar and frequently mix until the butter melts and sugar dissolves.

⦁ Increase the heat and reduce the sauce for about 3 minutes until it thickens sup. Stir frequently.  
⦁ Remove the skillet from heat. Place the apple cubes back in the caramel so that they are arranged in a circle.  
⦁ Now cover the apples with shortcrust pastry that you trimmed earlier. Once the pastry sits nicely on the top of the skillet, poke a few holes using a knife or fork.  
⦁ Place the skillet in a preheated oven at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes or until the pastry crisps up and turns golden.  
⦁ Once done, let it reach room temperature, invert and Enjoy!
