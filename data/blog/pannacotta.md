Panna cotta is simple, elegant, effortless, and delicious. It is a delicacy that can win every heart. This Italian custard is giggly, perfectly set, and smooth texture. Topped with rich caramel syrup and fresh berries, nothing can get wrong with a simple vanilla panna cotta.

## Origin of Panna Cotta

Panna cotta is a widely known and loved dessert with its roots in Italy. This dessert is a delicacy all around the world. However, its origin is a bit hazy. One thing we know for sure is that it was originated from Italy, but there is no clear evidence on when and how the dessert came into being.

In 1879, a dessert called Latte Inglese was widely popular. It had the same preparation method as the modern panna cotta. However, in the 1960&#39;s that the first ever record of panna cotta was made in an Italian cookbook. In the early 1990s, the dessert gained sudden popularity in America and then in the rest of the world.
