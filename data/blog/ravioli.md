# Handmade Mushroom Ravioli

Handmade mushroom and garlic ravioli are rich, creamy, and delicious. The flavorsome mushroom and garlic filling in a homemade pasta sheet drenched in a creamy sauce are heartwarming.

## Origin of Ravioli

Just like any other pasta, ravioli was originated in Italy around the 14th century. These pockets filled with delicious filling are usually served with a sauce. Moreover, they are also found in the culinary records of Rome and England around the 14th century. It is thought that they traveled with the migrants and quickly became popular all around the world.

### Ingredients

**For the pasta dough:**  
2 cups all-purpose flour  
2 eggs  
3 egg yolks

**For the filling:**  
5 cups crimini mushrooms, sliced  
200g of ricotta cheese
2 tbsp grated parmesan  
2 shallots, finely chopped  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
½ tsp parsley, chopped  
1 tbsp olive oil  
Black pepper, to taste  
Salt, to taste

**For the sauce:**  
1 cup heavy cream  
1 tbsp white wine  
½ tbsp olive oil  
1 clove garlic  
2 tbsp grated parmesan  
½ tsp fresh thyme, chopped  
Black pepper, to taste  
Salt, to taste

### Instructions

**For the pasta dough:**  
⦁ In a large bowl, add all-purpose flour and make a well in the center. Add whole eggs and egg yolks. Whisk the eggs using a fork.  
⦁ Start adding flour from the sides onto the eggs and start mixing them using your hands. Continue to knead the ingredients until you get a dough.  
⦁ Lastly, wrap it in clingfilm and refrigerate for 30 minutes.  
**For the mushroom filling:**  
⦁ Meanwhile, heat oil in a large pan.  
⦁ Add shallots and garlic, cook for a minute or until they are translucent.  
⦁ Next, add sliced mushrooms and cook until they are soft.  
⦁ Add parsley, black pepper and salt. Cook for two more minutes and set aside to cool down.  
⦁ Once the mushrooms cool down, add them into a food processor bowl. Add ricotta and parmesan cheese and process for 20 seconds until you get a paste.

**Assembly:**  
⦁ Roll out the pasta dough into a thin sheet using a machine or by hand as preferred.  
⦁ Place the pasta sheet on a floured working surface. Place the filling of mushrooms in the sheet by an inch squared difference until you reach half of the sheet. With practice, you'll know your preferred size for the ravioli!
⦁ Place the other end of the sheet so that it covers the mushroom mixture. Seal the sides by applying pressure of your fingers. If there is too much flour the sheets won't stick and you might need to add a little bit of water on one side to stick.  
⦁ Using a cutter, trim the sides around the filling so that you get small pockets of ravioli.  
⦁ Add water in a large pot, season it with salt, add oil and bring it to a boil. Add ravioli and cook for 4 minutes.

**For The Sauce:**  
⦁ Meanwhile, heat oil in a pan over medium heat.  
⦁ Add heavy cream, white wine, thyme, salt, and pepper.  
⦁ Once the mixture begins boiling, lower the heat and let it simmer until it has the desired consistency.  
⦁ Add parmesan cheese and mix well.  
⦁ Add cooked ravioli straight from the boiling pot and toss.  
⦁ Serve.
**Note:** You may add mozzarella cheese while boiling the cream to add more flavor and consistency.
