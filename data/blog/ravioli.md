### Ingredients

**For the pasta dough:**  
2 cups all-purpose Flour  
2 eggs  
3 egg Yolks

**For the filling:**  
5 cups cremini mushrooms, sliced  
¾ cup of ricotta cheese
2 tbsp grated parmesan  
3 shallots, finely chopped  
3 garlic cloves, minced  
½ tsp parsley, chopped  
1 tbsp olive oil  
black pepper, to taste  
Salt, to taste

**For the sauce:**  
1 cup heavy cream  
1 tbsp white wine  
½ tbsp olive oil  
2 tbsp grated parmesan  
½ tsp fresh thyme, chopped  
black pepper, to taste  
Salt, to taste

### Instructions

**For the pasta dough:**  
⦁ In a large bowl, add all-purpose flour and make a well in the center. Add whole eggs and egg yolks. Whisk the eggs using a fork.  
⦁ Start adding flour from the sides onto the eggs and start mixing them using your hands. Continue to knead the ingredients until you get a dough.  
⦁ Lastly, wrap it in clingfilm and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

**For the mushroom filling:**  
⦁ Meanwhile, heat oil in a large pan.  
⦁ Add shallots and garlic, cook for a minute or until they are translucent.  
⦁ Next, add sliced mushrooms and cook until they are soft.  
⦁ Add parsley, black pepper and salt. Cook for two more minutes and set aside to cool down.  
⦁ Once the mushrooms cool down, add them into a bowl. Add ricotta and parmesan cheese and mix throughtly.  
⦁ Set aside.

**Assembly:**  
⦁ Roll out the pasta dough into a thin sheet using a machine or by hand as preferred.  
⦁ Place the pasta sheet on a floured working surface. Place the filling of mushrooms in the sheet by an inch squared difference until you reach half of the sheet. With practice, you'll know your preferred size for the ravioli!  
⦁ Place the other end of the sheet so that it covers the mushroom mixture. Seal the sides by applying pressure of your fingers. If there is too much flour the sheets won't stick and you might need to add a little bit of water on one side to stick.  
⦁ Using a cutter, trim the sides around the filling so that you get small pockets of ravioli.  
⦁ Flour a little bit the raviolis to prevent them from sticking to the surface of a baking tin and let them rest there.  
⦁ Add water in a large pot, season it with salt, add oil and bring it to a boil. Add ravioli and cook for 5 minutes.  
⦁ Strain the raviolis with a colander and serve with sauce.

**For the sauce:**  
⦁ Meanwhile, heat oil in a pan over medium heat.  
⦁ Add heavy cream, white wine, thyme, salt, and pepper.  
⦁ Once the mixture begins boiling, let the sauce boil until it has the desired consistency.  
⦁ Add parmesan cheese and mix well.  
⦁ Add cooked ravioli straight from the boiling pot and toss.  
⦁ Serve.

**Note:** You may add mozzarella or cheddar while boiling the cream to add more flavor and consistency.
