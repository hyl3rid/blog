Vegetable lasagna is a scrumptious, wholesome, and easy-to-make dish that you can enjoy with your friends and family on weekends.

## Origin of Lasagna

When it comes to the culinary world, Naples, a city in Italy, has a lot of contributions to make. Apart from the famous pizza, Naples has also given us lasagna. It originated somewhere in the Middle Ages. However, it wasn't until the 14th century that the mention of lasagna came into a cookbook which particularly the recipe didn't include tomatoes in any way . It wasn’t until the 1800s that tomato sauce was used an integral part of lasagna. Today you can enjoy lasagna in almost any way.

A pinch nutmeg

### Instructions

⦁ In a large bowl, add mozzarella cheese and grated parmesan cheese. Mix well and set aside.
