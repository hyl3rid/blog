Vegetable lasagna is a scrumptious, wholesome, and easy-to-make dish that you can enjoy with your friends and family on weekends.

## Origin of Lasagna

When it comes to the culinary world, Naples, a city in Italy, has a lot of contributions to make. Apart from the famous pizza, Naples has also given us lasagna. It originated somewhere in the Middle Ages. However, it wasn't until the 14th century that the mention of lasagna came into a cookbook which particularly the recipe didn't include tomatoes in any way . It wasn’t until the 1800s that tomato sauce was used an integral part of lasagna. Today you can enjoy lasagna in almost any way.

⦁ ¼ cup flour  
⦁ 2 tbsp butter  
⦁ 2 cups milk  
⦁ A pinch nutmeg

### Instructions

**For the vegetable filling:**

⦁ Slice the eggplant into rounds and add salt to each side. Place the rounds in a colander with a bowl underneath to catch the liquid from the eggplant.  
⦁ Heat the oven to 400 degrees F and oil a baking dish.  
⦁ Core the bell pepper and remove seeds. Trim sides of the onions and cut in fourths. Crush garlic to remove peel and core. Cut the tomato into 4 pieces. Place the onions, garlic, tomatoes, bell pepper in the baking dish and drizzle the vegetables with olive oil, add salt and herbs.  
⦁ Into the oven, let it cook for 30 minutes.  
⦁ After the vegetables are cooked in the oven, take them out. Place the garlic, onions, bell pepper and the tomatoes in a saucepan.  
⦁ Crush the garlic, onions and the tomatoes, they should be soft. Finally mix throughly so all ingredients incorporate.  
⦁ The other vegetables will be left apart until we assemble the lasagna.  
⦁ Add italian seasoning and check for salt and pepper to the tomato mix. If there is too much liquid, heat up the saucepan. When it starts to boil lower the heat to simmer. Cook until the consistency of the tomato sauce is as desired by evaporation.

**For the béchamel sauce:**

⦁ In a saucepan, add butter and place it on medium-low heat. Add flour and whisk it slowly for about 2 minutes to ensure the butter covers the flour particles.  
⦁ Take the saucepan off the heat and slowly pour a little of warm milk while whisking and mix well. Gradually pour all the milk into the sauce, place the saucepan back on the heat and continue to whisk until no lumps are left.  
⦁ Let the mixture cook for about 5 minutes until it is creamy. Add a pinch of nutmeg and season with salt and black pepper according to your liking.

### Assembly:

⦁ At the bottom of the casserole dish place some béchamel sauce evenly to form a bed of the sauce.  
⦁ The cooked lasagna sheets are added on top of the sauce.  
⦁ Next, scoop the tomato mixture, then the eggplant, zucchini, mushrooms and spinach spread it evenly.  
⦁ Now cover with mozzarella and parmesan cheese.  
⦁ Repeat the layers in the following order pasta, béchamel, tomato sauce, vegetables and cheese until done.  
⦁ Top the lasagna with the remaining béchamel and cover with cheese and parmesan.  
⦁ Place the casserole dish in a preheated oven at 375 degrees F for about 40 minutes until the top is bubbling.  
⦁ Finally set the oven to broil for 5 minutes so the cheese will turn brown on the top. Be attentive to the lasagna because the cheese could get burnt.  
⦁ Take out of the oven and let the lasagna cool a few minutes. Serve.
