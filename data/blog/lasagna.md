Vegetable lasagna is a scrumptious, wholesome, and easy-to-make dish that you can enjoy with your friends and family on weekends.

## Origin of Lasagna

When it comes to the culinary world, Naples, a city in Italy, has a lot of contributions to make. Apart from the famous pizza, Naples has also given us lasagna. It originated somewhere in the Middle Ages. However, it wasn't until the 14th century that the mention of lasagna came into a cookbook which particularly the recipe didn't include tomatoes in any way . It wasn’t until the 1800s that tomato sauce was used an integral part of lasagna. Today you can enjoy lasagna in almost any way.

## Vegetable Lasagna Recipe

**Preparation time:** 20 minutes  
**Cooking time:** 60 minutes  
**Total time:** 1 hour 20 minutes  
**Servings:** 6

For the lasagna:

- 10-ounce lasagna sheets, cooked
- 3 cups mozzarella cheese, shredded
- 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, grated
- 1 tbsp olive oil

For the vegetable filling:

- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 white onions, chopped
- 1 bell pepper, chopped
- 4 big tomatoes, chopped
- 1 small zucchini, sliced
- 1/2 small eggplant, sliced
- 2 cups cremini mushrooms, quartered
- 3 cups fresh spinach, roughly chopped
- 2 tbsp Italian seasoning
- Salt and black pepper, to taste

For the béchamel sauce:

- 1/4 cup butter
- 1/4 cup flour
- 2 cups milk
- A pinch of nutmeg
- Salt and black pepper, to taste

Instructions:

- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
- Slice the eggplant into rounds and sprinkle salt on both sides. Place the rounds in a colander and set it over a bowl to catch the liquid.
- In a baking dish, combine the garlic, onions, bell pepper, and tomatoes. Drizzle olive oil over the vegetables and season with salt, black pepper, and Italian seasoning.
- Roast the vegetables in the oven for 30 minutes or until they are cooked.
- Remove the vegetables from the oven and transfer them to a saucepan. Crush the garlic, onions, and tomatoes until they are soft. Mix thoroughly so that all the ingredients are incorporated.
- Add the Italian seasoning to the tomato mixture and adjust the seasoning with salt and black pepper. If the sauce has too much liquid, simmer it on low heat until it reaches the desired consistency.
- In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 2 minutes.
- Gradually pour the milk into the flour mixture, whisking continuously to avoid lumps. Cook the sauce for 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until it is creamy.
- Add a pinch of nutmeg to the sauce and season with salt and black pepper.
- To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of béchamel sauce on the bottom of a casserole dish.
- Add a layer of cooked lasagna sheets, followed by a layer of tomato mixture, eggplant, zucchini, mushrooms, and spinach. Sprinkle mozzarella and parmesan cheese on top.
- Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of béchamel sauce and cheese.
- Bake the lasagna in the preheated oven at 375 degrees F for 40 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly.
- Turn the oven to broil and cook for an additional 5 minutes, watching carefully to avoid burning the cheese.
- Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before serving.
