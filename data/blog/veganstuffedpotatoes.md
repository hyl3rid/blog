⦁ Using a sharp knife, cut them horizontally or lengthwise in half. Now you have four potato boats.  
⦁ Scoop the center of the potatoes to ensure the center is hollow, and you get perfect boats.  
⦁ You can use the cooked potato to make mashed potatoes or mix it in the mushroom mixture. It’s your choice.  
⦁ Scoop the mushroom mixture and add it into the potato boats.  
⦁ Add vegan mozzarella cheese, vegan parmesan cheese, and chopped parsley in a bowl mix. Mix well
