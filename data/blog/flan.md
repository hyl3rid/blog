## Origin of flan

Flan is a popular dessert of the Latin world. However, it is not just a dessert; instead is a phenomenon. You will find its variations in different cultures; however, its origin is traced back to the ancient Roman Empire. The Romans were the first to combine eggs and milk to make a flat custard called &quot;Faldo.&quot;

However, it was after the fall of this empire and the arrival of the Spaniards that the Roman &quot;Faldo&quot; turned into a sweet, rich, decadent flan we know today.

### Ingredients

2 cups whole milk  
1 ½ cups white sugar  
4 large eggs  
1 tbsp vanilla extract

### Instructions

- Start by cracking the eggs in a standing mixer&#39;s bowl.
- Add half a cup of sugar, and whisk at medium speed for about 3 minutes or until you get a creamy mixture.
- Pour milk and vanilla extract. Whisk for a few seconds until everything is well combined.
- In a small to medium saucepan, add a cup of white granulated sugar and place it on low/medium heat.
- Stir constantly and let the sugar dissolve until it turns into a liquid and gets a golden brown color. Keep a close eye on the sugar and stir it constantly; otherwise, it will burn.
- Once the sugar is dissolved and is golden brown take the saucepan off the heat and scoop out the sugar. Pour it directly into the ramekins. If the sugar starts to solidify, heat it until it is liquid again and pour into the ramekins.
- Pour the mixture of milk and eggs equally into the ramekins just above the sugar.
- Place the ramekins in a large baking dish. Fill the baking dish with water to make the ramekins about ¼ inch in it.
- Cover the ramekins with aluminum foil and place the baking dish in a preheated oven at 350 degrees F for about an hour.
- After an hour, take the baking dish out of the oven. Remove the aluminum foil from the top of the ramekin and check its texture. It should be firm. If it&#39;s not set yet, give it some additional time in the oven.
- Once done, take the ramekins out of the oven and baking dish. Let them sit until they have reached room temperature. Refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours.
- To serve, run a sharp knife along the sides of the ramekin. Place a serving place on it and carefully invert the ramekin. Enjoy.
