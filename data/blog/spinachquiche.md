Spinach quiche is a simple yet delicious dish you can enjoy for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. There are multiple variations of this dish. If you feel just spinach does not make it, you can add more vegetables like zuchinni, mushrooms or cherry tomatoes to make it even healthier and tasteful.

## Origin of Quiche

Quince is known to belong to French cuisine. However, not many know that it originated from Germany in the medieval era. Actually, it is more like a territorial thing. The kingdom of Lothringian, which was the birthplace of Quiche, came under German rule, which was later made a part of the French rule. So, today it is an integral dish in French cuisine. It was after WW2 that it gained popularity in England and U.S. It is a pastry shell filled with custard or a savory blend of vegetables, leafy greens, meat, and an egg and cream mixture. Today, you can find several variations of quiche perfect for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

⦁ Chill a pie dish and then greased it lightly with oil to avoid the pastry from sticking. Go ahead and pick up the rolled dought with the back of your hands and place it into a the pie dish. Press the dought gently so it fits tightly and trim the excess pastry.  
⦁ Pierce the bottom of the pastry with a fork.  
⦁ Place the tin in a preheated oven at 350 degree fahrenheit for about 20 minutes or until it is golden in colour.

⦁ Whisk eggs in a medium bowl. Add heavy cream, black pepper, and salt. Mix well.  
⦁ Once the pie crust is cool, place the onion and spinach mixture at the bottom of the pie.  
⦁ Next, sprinkle shredded cheddar cheese evenly.  
⦁ Pour the egg and heavy cream mixture on top of the cheese.  
⦁ Place the baking pan into a preheated oven at 375 degrees F for about 30 minutes or until the top gets a golden color.
