# Spinach Quiche

Spinach quiche is a simple yet delicious dish you can enjoy for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. There are multiple variations of this dish. If you feel just spinach does not make it, you can add more vegetables like zuchinni, mushrooms or cherry tomatoes to make it even healthier and tasteful.

## Origin of Quiche

Quince is known to belong to French cuisine. However, not many know that it originated from Germany in the medieval era. Actually, it is more like a territorial thing. The kingdom of Lothringian, which was the birthplace of Quiche, came under German rule, which was later made a part of the French rule. So, today it is an integral dish in French cuisine. It was after WW2 that it gained popularity in England and U.S. It is a pastry shell filled with custard or a savory blend of vegetables, leafy greens, meat, and an egg and cream mixture. Today, you can find several variations of quiche perfect for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

## Spinach Quiche Recipe

### For the shortcrust pastry 9 inch:

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 6 tbsp unsalted butter, chilled and cubed
- 1 ½ tbsp ground flaxseed + 3 ½ tbsp water or 1 large egg
- ¼ tsp salt

### For the filling:

- 1 ½ cups baby spinach, fresh or frozen
- 1 tbsp unsalted butter
- ½ cup onion, thinly sliced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 4 large eggs
- 1 ¼ cups heavy cream
- 1 cup cheddar cheese, shredded
- ½ tsp black pepper
- ½ tsp salt

## Instructions

### For the shortcrust pastry:

- In a large bowl, mix all-purpose flour with salt.
- Add cubed butter to the flour and use your hands to combine the butter and flour until you get a crumbly mixture.
- If using flaxseed, mix it with the water, let it rest for 10-15 minutes and then add it to the flour mixture. If using an egg, lightly beat it and add it to the flour mixture.
- Use your hands to gently work the mixture into a dough.
- Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 20 minutes.
- Place the dough on a floured surface and roll it out using a rolling pin until it's a 1/8 inch thick round sheet.
- Grease a 9-inch pie dish with oil and chill it. Place the rolled dough over the dish and press it tightly to fit. Trim the excess dough.
- Pierce the bottom of the dough with a fork.
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and bake the pastry for about 15-18 minutes, or until it's lightly golden in color. Let it cool down.

### For the filling:

- Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add sliced onions and minced garlic, sauté for 3 minutes until the onions turn translucent.
- Add fresh baby spinach to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes until it withers. Remove from heat and let it cool.
- In a medium bowl, whisk eggs. Add heavy cream, black pepper, and salt. Mix well.
- Spread the onion and spinach mixture over the baked pastry.
- Sprinkle shredded cheddar cheese over the mixture.
- Pour the egg and heavy cream mixture over the cheese.
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and bake for about 30 minutes or until the top is golden brown in color and the filling is set.
- Let it cool for 10-15 minutes before serving. Enjoy!
