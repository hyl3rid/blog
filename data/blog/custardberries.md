## Origin of Custard Tart

Most people consider custard tart to have a French or Portuguese origin, but the early evidence of custard tart goes back to the 13th century.

### Ingredients

1 egg  
¼ cup butter, cut into pieces  
1 Tbsp granulated sugar

2 tbsp cornstarch  
1 tsp vanilla extract

**For topping:**

### Instructions

**For the Shell**

- In the food processor bowl, add all-purpose flour, sugar and salt.
- Add butter and start processing for about a minute or two until you get a crumbly mixture.
- Next, add an egg and continue to process until the mixture forms a dough.
- Take the dough out of the process and place it on a floured workstation. Gently knead the dough once or twice, shape it into it, and wrap it with plastic wrap.
- Place the dough in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.
- Take the dough out of the refrigerator, unwrap it and place it on a floured workstation.
- Roll it into a circle using a rolling pin.
- Line the tart tin with parchment paper and place the rolled dough sheet onto the tart tin. Trim the sides.
- Pierce the bottom of the pastry using a sharp knife or a fork.
- Place the tin in a preheated oven for about 25 minutes or until it is golden in colour.
- Once done, take it out of the oven and let it cool down.

**For the custard**

- In a saucepan, pour milk. Add sugar, vanilla. Place the saucepan on medium heat.
- Add cornflour and about 2 tbsp water to form a slurry in a separate bowl. Add egg yolks and beat with a hand blender or whisk until everything is well incorporated.
- Once the milk mixture heats up, take the saucepan off the heat and let it sit for some time so that the milk mixture is warm but not very hot.
- Slowly pour the egg yolk mixture into the saucepan while mixing at medium-low speed. Once everything is incorporated, place the saucepan back on medium/low heat. Let it cook for 5 minutes until the mixture thickens up. Stir constantly.
- Once done, remove the saucepan from heat and let it cool down a bit. Pour it into the tart shell and place it in the refrigerator for at least an hour to set.
- Just before serving, garnish the custard tart with fresh berries and fruits. Arrange them in a circle and enjoy!
