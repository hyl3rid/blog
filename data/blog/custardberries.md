### Instructions

**For the shortcrust pastry:**  
⦁ In a large bowl mix all-purpose flour with salt, confectioners sugar and butter. With your hands combine the butter and flour until you get a crumbly mixture.  
⦁ If you selected flaxseed, mix it with the water, let it rest for 10-15 minutes and add it to the flour. Else if you selected to use an egg, just lightly beat it and add the egg to the flour.  
⦁ Start working on the mixture using your hands gently until it shapes into a dough.  
⦁ Wrap the dought in plastic wrap and refrigerate the dought for 20 minutes.  
⦁ Now place the dought on a floured working surface and roll it using a rolling pin until you get a 1/8 inch thick round sheet.  
⦁ Chill a 9 inch pie dish and then greased it lightly with oil to avoid the pastry from sticking. Go ahead and pick up the rolled dought with the back of your hands and place it into a the pie dish. Press the dought so it fits tightly and trim the excess pastry.  
⦁ Pierce the bottom of the pastry with a fork.  
⦁ Place the tin in a preheated oven at 350 degree fahrenheit for about 25 minutes or until it is golden in colour.  
⦁ Once done, take it out of the oven and let it cool down.

**For the custard cream:**  
⦁ In a saucepan, pour coconut milk/cream. Add sugar, vanilla. Place the saucepan on medium heat.  
⦁ Mix cornstarch and about 2 tbsp water to form a slurry in a separate small bowl.  
⦁ Once the milk mixture heats up lower the heat to medium/low, add the cornstarch with water mixture and let it cook for 15 minutes so the mixture develops flavor and thickens up well. Stir constantly.  
⦁ Once done, remove the saucepan from heat and let it cool down a bit. Then place it in the refrigerator until it is cold.  
⦁ Finally pour the cream into the tart shell and garnish the custard tart with fresh berries and fruits. Arrange them in a circle and add dissolved agar agar with sugar on top of the fruits to give them a brilliant color.  
⦁ Store the tart in the refrigerator until served.
