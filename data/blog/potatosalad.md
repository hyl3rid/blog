## Origin of Potato Salad with Mayonnaise

Mayonnaise is an integral part of potato salad today, but it wasn&#39;t like this forever. Since potato salad was invented years before mayonnaise, the early version of potato salad was made by boiling the potatoes in wine and serving them with spices. Potato salad is believed to have originated from Germany. It was from here that it spread into Europe and then in Asia. You can also find potato salad in Japanese cuisine, and they widely use mayonnaise.

In the year 1756, a French chef made accidentally created mayonnaise. It was preparing a mixture of cream and eggs, and since he didn&#39;t have cream at hand, he used olive oil.

No one knows when mayonnaise became a part of potato salad. Some believe that it happened in the 1900s when mayonnaise made its way into the market. However, many believe that it was in America that people started to add mayonnaise to potato salad.

### Ingredients

**For the vegan mayonnaise:**  
1/4 of [aquafaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquafaba "Water in which chickpeas were cooked.")  
1 ½ tbsp lemon juice  
1 tsp mustard  
olive oil as needed  
Salt, to taste

**For the potato salad:**  
1 ¼ lb. Yukon Gold potatoes

¼ cup red onion, diced  
½ tbsp parsley, freshly chopped  
1 cup mayonnaise  
¼ tbsp apple cider vinegar  
½ tbsp Dijon mustard  
Black pepper, to taste  
Salt, to taste

### Instructions

**For the mayonnaise:**

1. Add aquafaba, mustard, lemon juice, and salt in a inmersion blender jug. Note I didn't have success using a traditional blender as it would sprinkle everything. Blend for 2 minutes until creamy texture.
2. Continue to blend and slowly add drizzled olive oil for a moment, then stop adding oil and blend everything and add more oil slowly. Continue blending and adding oil until the desired consistency is obtained. This is thanks to emulsification.

**For the potato salad:**

1. Fill a large pot with water and place it on medium heat. Add washed and scrubbed potatoes and boil them for 15 to 20 minutes or until they are cooked.
2. Drain the potatoes, peel them and cut them into inch cubes. Place the potato cubes in a large bowl.
3. Once the potatoes are cool enough, add mayonnaise, celery, apple, red onions, parsley, apple cider vinegar, Dijon mustard, black pepper, and salt.
4. Mix the ingredients thoroughly until everything is unified, and get a creamy salad.
5. Place the salad in the refrigerator and serve chilled. Garnish with parsley.
