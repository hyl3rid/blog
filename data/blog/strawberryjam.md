Strawberry jam is a sweet and tangy spread made from fresh strawberries, sugar, and lemon juice. The strawberries are cooked down to a thick, syrupy consistency that is perfect for spreading on toast, biscuits, or scones. Homemade strawberry jam is easy to make and a delicious way to preserve the sweet taste of fresh summer berries all year round.

# Origin of Strawberry Jam

The first recorded recipe for strawberry jam can be traced back to the early 1700s in England. Since then, this classic spread has become a staple in kitchens around the world, especially during strawberry season when the fruit is at its peak ripeness.

## Ingredients and Quantity

To make your own homemade strawberry jam, you'll need the following ingredients:

- 4 cups of fresh strawberries, washed, hulled, and mashed
- 2 cups of granulated sugar 
- half a lemon of freshly squeezed juice

Note: This recipe makes approximately 2 pints of jam.

Steps

- Prepare the strawberries: Wash the strawberries thoroughly, remove the stems and cut them into small pieces. Using a potato masher or fork, mash the strawberries until they are broken down into small chunks.

- Cook the strawberries: In a large, non-reactive pot, combine the mashed strawberries, sugar, and lemon juice. Heat the mixture over medium-high heat, stirring frequently until the sugar dissolves.

- Boil the mixture: Increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil. Stir the mixture constantly, scraping the bottom of the pot to prevent it from sticking.

- Check the temperature: Using a candy thermometer, check the temperature of the jam. Once it reaches 220°F (104°C), remove the pot from the heat.

- Test for doneness: To test if the jam has reached the desired consistency, place a small amount on a cold plate and let it sit for a few seconds. If it wrinkles when you push it with your finger, it's ready. If it's still too runny, return the pot to the heat and boil for a few more minutes, then test again.

- Can the jam: While the jam is still hot, carefully pour it into sterilized jars and seal with lids. Let the jars cool completely before storing them in the refrigerator or pantry.

Assembly

If you want to take your strawberry jam to the next level, consider adding some extra flavors or ingredients. Here are a few ideas:

- Vanilla: Add a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the jam before boiling.
-Balsamic vinegar: Stir in a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar to give the jam a tangy flavor.
-Mint: Chop up some fresh mint leaves and add them to the jam while it's cooking.
- Jalapeño: For a spicy kick, finely chop a jalapeño pepper and add it to the pot while cooking.

In conclusion, making your own strawberry jam is a fun and rewarding activity that results in a delicious spread that can be enjoyed all year round. With just a few simple ingredients and some patience, you can create a sweet and fruity jam that's perfect for spreading on toast, biscuits, or scones. So why not give it a try and impress your family and friends with your homemade jam-making skills?
