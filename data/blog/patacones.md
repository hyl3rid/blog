Crispy and savory patacones are paired with creamy mashed beans, fresh and tangy pico de gallo, and classic guacamole to create a delicious Latin American dish.

## Origin of the Dish:

They are made from green plantains that are twice-fried to create a crispy exterior and a tender interior. They are commonly served with various toppings or dips, such as mashed beans, pico de gallo, and guacamole.

## Ingredients Quantity:

**For the patacones:**

- 2 green plantains
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- Salt to taste

**For the mashed beans:**

- 1 can of black or pinto beans, drained and rinsed
- 1/4 cup chopped onion
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- pinch of ground cumin
- Salt to taste

**For the pico de gallo:**

- 1 medium tomato, diced
- 1/4 cup chopped onion
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- Salt to taste

**For the guacamole:**

- 2 ripe avocados
- 1/4 cup chopped purple onion
- 1 small jalapeño pepper, seeded and minced (optional)
- 2 tablespoons lime juice
- Salt to taste

**Steps:**

- To make the patacones, cut the ends off the plantains and score the skin lengthwise with a knife. Peel the skin off and slice the plantains into 1-inch thick rounds.
- In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat until hot. Add the plantain rounds and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, until lightly browned. Remove the plantains with a slotted spoon and place them on a cutting board.
- Use a flat object like a jar or a plate to press down on each plantain round, flattening them to about 1/4-inch thickness.
- Return the flattened plantains to the skillet and fry for an additional 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden brown and crispy. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. Season with salt to taste.
- To make the mashed beans, heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and sauté for 2-3 minutes, until softened.
- Add the drained beans, cumin, salt, and pepper to the saucepan. Mash the beans with a potato masher or fork until they reach the desired consistency. Keep warm until ready to serve.
- To make the pico de gallo, mix together the diced tomato, onion, cilantro, lime juice, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Adjust seasoning to taste.
- To make the guacamole, cut the avocados in half and remove the pit. Scoop the avocado flesh into a bowl and mash with a fork until chunky. Mix in the onion, lime juice, salt, and pepper to taste.

Assembly:

To serve, place the warm patacones on a platter and top with a spoonful of mashed beans, a dollop of guacam
